# "Apply report" workflow (mandatory)

When the USER says **"apply report"**, interpret that as an instruction to:

1) **Read** the current project's `REPORT.md`.
2) **Identify** all entries whose `- **Status**:` is `unresolved` or `mitigated`.
3) **Fix** each issue by:
   - Reproducing the problem (when feasible) with safe, minimal commands.
   - Applying a **permanent fix** (config/script/code change) rather than a one-off workaround.
   - Avoiding new fragility (keep the single-entry `run.ps1` pattern).
4) **Verify** the fix by re-running the relevant command(s).
5) **Update `REPORT.md`**:
   - Do **not** delete or rewrite existing history.
   - Append a **new** entry for each applied fix if needed.
   - If an old entry was `unresolved`/`mitigated`, append a short follow-up note under it (or a new entry referencing it) indicating the permanent fix and set final `- **Status**:` to `resolved` when verified.

## Constraints
- Prefer PowerShell 7 commands on Windows.
- If a fix requires user-wide machine changes (PATH, ExecutionPolicy, installs), document the steps and also add a project-local mitigation when possible (e.g., clearer preflight diagnostics).
